# Superhero Clash

This application simulates two heores / villians fighting eachother and seeing who comes out stronger. 


It gets all the data from the Superhero API - https://superheroapi.com/index.html


It asks the user to type two heroes names and then it takes them to a page where it shows all the stats for the fighters and who comes out on top.
